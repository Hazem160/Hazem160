## Hi there 👋

 Welcome to my repositories, I will be trying to update and constantly improve the quality of my code while progressively undertaking 
 even more challenging projects. I will greatly appreciate any guidance and feedback from the viewer, especially if experienced.
 I hope we all learn together something new and improve in our skills as developers!👍
 
## Who I am 

   I am a Python software developer, on the path (hopefully right one) to apply and improve my gained knwoledge in a
   team or work environment, in doing so sharing our knowledge while helping each other out. I have also been exposed
   to web development using Django framework with Javascript in creating full stack applications.

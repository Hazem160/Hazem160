## Hi there üëã

 Welcome to my repositories, I will be trying to update and constantly improve the quality of my code while progressively undertaking 
 even more challenging projects. I will greatly appreciate any guidance and feedback from the viewer, especially if experienced.
 I hope we all learn together something new and improve in our skills as developers!üëç
 
## Who I am üßë

   I am a Python software developer, on the path (hopefully right one) to apply and improve my gained knwoledge in a
   team or work environment, in doing so sharing our knowledge while helping each other out. I have also been exposed
   to web development using Django framework with Javascript in creating full stack applications. I strive to ensure efficient 
   and accurate code operation while consistently honing my skills. I'm dedicated to collaborating with teams to achieve common 
   goals, always implementing best practices to enhance software functionality and performance. I enjoy applying <br>
   problem-solving skills and tackling challenges as I deem them to be both a demanding and rewarding experience.
